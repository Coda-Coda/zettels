# Welcome

Welcome to my (Daniel Britten's) public Zettelkasten. This is kind of like a blog 🙂

The name "Zettelkasten" means "idea box", for more information see [this information about it](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/).

To generate your own site like this see the [emanote-template](https://github.com/srid/emanote-template) which is powered by [emanote](https://github.com/srid/emanote). Also, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is used to automatically publish this site every time the underlying Git repository gets updated. You can even use an app that supports Git on mobile to edit and publish on the go.

A site like this is completely free to run!
