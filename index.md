# Welcome

Welcome to my (Daniel Britten's) public Zettelkasten. This is kind of like a blog üôÇ

The name "Zettelkasten" means "idea box", for more information see [this information about it](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/).

Here is a link to the "contents page" where you can find the articles/blog posts I have written:

To generate your own site like this see the [neuron-template](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template) which is powered by [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/). Also, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is used to automatically publish this site every time the underlying Git repository gets updated.

A site like this is completely free to run!
