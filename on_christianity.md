# On Christianity

This folder will include some collected thoughts of mine on Christianity, ideas about God and related questions I am wrestling with. Please don’t take the fact that this is publicly available to mean that I think I have “all the answers”, I certainly don’t. I do however value the potential discussion and interaction this may bring which I imagine may most often occur by me directly sharing specific pages with people that I discuss these topics with in ‘real life’. But also I would value interactions on this site and invite comments, please see [[reader_interaction]]. 

It is well worth stating that I do call myself a Christian. I say that with caution because I know there still can be some negative perceptions this can incite that could have negatively consequences for me. However, all things considered I am not ashamed of what I believe and ultimately I do think that what I believe helps me towards living a fulfilling life as well as with coping in tough times and that at least some aspects of what I post in this folder may be of help to others - potentially greatly of help. Also, I value refining my beliefs and being open to comments here (again, really please see [[reader_interaction]] 🙂) so please do feel free to make comments, either publicly or if you just want me to see the comment you can create a private Hypothesis group and add me.

## Important
I want to highlight a couple of key ideas about what I believe about Christianity to clarify up-front some important notions and prevent potential misunderstandings about what I believe just because I use the term “Christianity”. I may add to this list in time.

### Universalism - everyone ends up reconciled with each other and with God
I do *not* believe that any person or sentient entity ends up being tortured in ‘hell’ for eternity. Rather, I believe that *all* get reconciled with each other and with God.

This affects how we see God in a wide range of ways and how we perceive God’s character. I am certainly not alone in this view, it is often called [[christian_universalism]]. There are various subtleties within that umbrella term, but the core idea of everyone being reconciled and ending up “in heaven” is the common ground and the most critical notion.
