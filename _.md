# ~All~

This folder holds all pages from this blog in the same directory. Note that clicking on each page will redirect automatically to the page within the folder structure. This is because some additional formatting settings and other features work best in folders.

However, this is the best way to share files in this Zettelkasten. This is because their position within the folders may well change, but their url within this folder will not change (in the near future).

## To share a page
 1. Open this folder (done)
 2. Right click (or long press) on the name of the article you want to share and *copy to clipboard*.
 3. Paste this link wherever you'd like to share it.

## All pages
```query
path:./*
