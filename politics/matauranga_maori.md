# Mātauranga Māori

This page will contain some collected thoughts of mine around the topic of mātauranga Māori. For me, my interest in understanding more about mātauranga Māori was sparked by discussions with a few people around [this Listener article](https://twitter.com/JoannaKidman/status/1418876703938465792?s=20) and related media articles such as [this RNZ article](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/447898/university-academics-claim-matauranga-maori-not-science-sparks-controversy).

I intend to spend some time understanding this all better in the hope of learning more about mātauranga Māori at the very least, and hopefully also understanding more about the racial tensions related to this and ways in which I can play the role I have in all this in a way which aligns with my values.

At the recommendation of a friend, I intend to look into:
 - Wai 262, e.g.

```
 - [[decolonising_methodologies]], e.g.

```

I'll add to this page in time. To be clear though, I'm not going to be anywhere close to an expert and please don't take that I am putting my summaries and thoughts up here to mean anything other than: I'm on a journey and am interested in learning, improving my understandings and how I may act going forward. To engage with me, I'm experimenting with [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), please see [[reader_interaction]].
