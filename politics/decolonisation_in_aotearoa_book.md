# Decolonisation in Aotearoa: Education, research and practice (book)

[This book](https://www.nzcer.org.nz/nzcerpress/decolonisation) has also been recommended in relation to [[matauranga_maori]]. For now, I have read the short book review [available here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40841-018-0115-6).

The concluding paragraph from the book review is:
> The book is provocative, illuminating and inspiring. It deserves to be read by scholars and educators alike, because it has the potential to shift how they approach the political issue of indigenous rights, where a large part of this is Māori and schooling. This edited collection skilfully communicates the decolonising project to another generation and renews the struggle for tino rangatiratanga by challenging the commitment of the state and government to Māori, while also celebrating the strength, resources, political strategy and innovative power of indigenous peoples.
