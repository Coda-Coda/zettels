## Notes
`plutus-playground-server -i 120s` to set timeout of playground if needed.

### ScriptContext
`txInfoValidRange` - If the current time does not fall into this time-frame, then validation fails immediately. So all scripts run locally that succeed will also succeed on a node if all the pre-validation checks pass (including the time-range check and that all UTXOs it uses are still unspent).

Slot number to time is _currently_ 1s. But this could change with a hard-fork, potentially. We know that the slot length won't change within the next 36 hours, due to the way that a hard-fork won't take effect. Overall, for `txInfoValidRange` we have to not put values further then 36 hours into the future in, except for âˆž in the future. **Note** that you can still have contracts that deal with time far in the future, this limitation is just about generating transactions that redeem these contracts with time-locks potentially many years in the future.
