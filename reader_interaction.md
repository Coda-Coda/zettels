# Interacting with this blog

I'm experimenting with [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) which allows anyone to annotate and comment on any part of this site. So please feel free to [get started with Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) and annotate these pages, either publicly, within a private group, or just private to yourself.

Also, this site is built from a GitHub repository. Please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/Coda-Coda/zettels/issues) there or [open a pull request](https://github.com/Coda-Coda/zettels/pulls), whether it's a small typo or an issue that you feel needs to be addressed.
