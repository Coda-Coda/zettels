# Interacting with this blog

I'm experimenting with [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) which allows anyone to annotate and comment on any part of this site. So please feel free to open the annotation sidebar on the top right and annotate these pages, either publicly, within a private group, or just private to yourself. You'll need to [sign up for Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/signup).

Also, this site is built from a GitHub repository. Please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/Coda-Coda/zettels/issues) there or [open a pull request](https://github.com/Coda-Coda/zettels/pulls), whether it's a small typo or an issue that you feel needs to be addressed.
