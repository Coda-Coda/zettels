## Notes
The beginning of the talk is powerfully emotive, hard to summarise well but it made me feel a small glimpse of the impact of racism and colonisation.

The perspective of Cook is fairly often seen as an overall positive impression, yet there is good reason to view him and their crew in a very negative light (to put it mildly). This has come to a head at times like when [the Captain Cook replica was banned from docking in Mangonui](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/398912/captain-cook-replica-banned-from-docking-in-mangonui-during-commemoration).

See also [the book](https://www.otago.ac.nz/press/books/otago066924.html).

The strong perception of many native peoples is that their people are the ones who the focus and _subject_ of research more than any other people. And I think in particular much more than the people groups who colonised them - across NZ, Australia, Canada, US and more.

The section at [this point and the few minutes afterwards](https://youtu.be/YSX_4FnqXwQ?t=1802) touches on the reactions academics may have to the idea of making some key changes to decolonise a discipline (and I imagine most if not all of the reactions she lists are based on real experience).
